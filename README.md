# IUS Student Eating Habits and Lifestyle  
### Statistical Modelling Project (MATH306)

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes eating habits, stress levels, and lifestyle behaviors among students at the **International University of Sarajevo (IUS)** using statistical hypothesis testing.

The study explores relationships between:
- Student stress levels  
- Meal and breakfast skipping behavior  
- Gender differences in stress  
- Comparisons with national benchmarks  

Statistical methods include **one-sample t-tests**, **two-sample t-tests**, and a **one-sample proportion test**.

---

## Data Collection
- Data was collected via an **anonymous online survey** administered to IUS students  
- **Sample size:** 70 students  
- **Collection method:** Mixed convenience sampling (online distribution + in-person QR codes)  
- No personally identifiable information was collected  

**Privacy note:**  
Raw survey responses are **not publicly shared** to protect participant anonymity.

## Methodology
The following hypotheses were tested:
1. Mean student stress level vs. moderate stress (one-sample *t*-test)  
2. Stress differences between students who skip meals and those who do not (two-sample *t*-test)  
3. Gender differences in stress levels (two-sample *t*-test)  
4. Breakfast skipping proportion vs. national benchmark (one-sample proportion test)  

All tests were conducted at a significance level of **α = 0.05**.

---

## Results Summary
Key findings include:
- IUS students report stress levels **significantly higher than moderate**
- Students who skip meals due to stress exhibit **higher stress levels**
- **Female students** report significantly higher stress than males
- Breakfast skipping among IUS students is **significantly higher than national averages**

Detailed interpretations and statistical outputs are provided in the final report.
